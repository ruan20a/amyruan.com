## Homework: Thursday December 5th

## Summary:

1. Portfolio Website
2. Linked List (optional)

## Portfolio Website

#TODO Why is this important

Create a `portfolio.md` file in your own folder and follow the directions below:

#### Find 5 Favorite Websites
List 5 favorite websites in your `portfolio.md` that you can be "inspired" from. Here are some of our favorite websites to find pretty websites:

- [http://www.thebestdesigns.com/](http://www.thebestdesigns.com/)
- [http://www.awwwards.com/](http://www.awwwards.com/)
- [http://bestwebgallery.com/](http://bestwebgallery.com/)
- [Here are my notes on some of my favorite websites!](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s225/sh/3c16c4dc-3e21-4bb1-8a85-ea649ff07afa/66d9bfe34d3f7c81717cadf5ee485dc0)
- [Site Inspire](http://www.siteinspire.com/)

#### User Stories & Wireframes
Similar to the way that we did our user stories for this morning's excercise, it is important to think about the flow of your user through your website as well. Due tomorrow for your portoflio is *just* these user stories and wireframes (obviously you will want your wireframes to be a lot more detailed for your portfolio project). I (Jonathan) personally would recommend using pencil to draw this.

In these wireframes, you want to be as specific as possible, also when I'm doing these, I redraw pages a bunch of times.

Here are some examples of the resolution of helpful wireframes:

## Linked List

Knowing how to do linked lists in and of themselves are not necessarily that important, it is the thinking skills that you develop from being able to translate what you want to do for this relatively complex task into specific actionable code. This is also going to be an interview question.

[PPT Slides](http://d.pr/f/aQTC)

Validate that you understand

- unshift
- to_a

In a TDD fashion (TEST FISRT), just choose 1 extra linked list funtion to implement:

- each
	- Note that this is very similar to to the way that you implemented `to_a`, in fact, it's probably only 2 lines of code different.
	- After you implement each, you can try changing to_a so that it it uses `each`

- fetch
- push
- insert
- delete_at

[see the slides for how these functions work]
